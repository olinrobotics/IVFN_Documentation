\section{Preface}

Hello Reader! \\ \\
%
\noindent My name is Justin Poh and I am (was) a senior at Olin College who graduated in May 2016. If you're reading this document, you must be working on the John Deere Gator XUV vehicle. Well, you're joining a unique group of individuals who have been working on this vehicle starting with the 2009 - 2010 SCOPE team. \\ \\

This document is meant to be a manual for how to run, use and work on the vehicle at the point that we left it. We also intended for this document to serve as something that can be continuously updated by subsequent teams of students in an easy and efficient manner. As such, in addition to the PDF and printed copies of this document, the original files are stored in a github repository at \url{https://github.com/olinrobotics/GatorResearch_Documentation}. Since everything was written in Latex, downloading any Latex editor should allow anyone to modify this document and update it as the state of the vehicle changes.\\ \\

I hope you find this document useful as you work on the vehicle and good luck! \\ \\

Cheers,\\ \\
